Hi everyone.

00:02.770 --> 00:04.730
So let's see to my third spot.

00:04.750 --> 00:07.870
We can apply on top of individual cities objects.

00:07.870 --> 00:11.750
So this is basically cities matter like our and unique might turn any unique mega.

00:11.980 --> 00:18.450
So a number of times so before processing Dateline and explaining the concept related to data frame

00:18.550 --> 00:21.060
object I have executed this matter.

00:21.250 --> 00:24.310
But now we are explicitly going to watch that.

00:24.490 --> 00:27.980
What this matter is so and unique and a unique matter.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.700
So let me just display first few records of this data frame object.

00:34.750 --> 00:42.350
Now there are some of the column that bind us as identified like an object column or a string column.

00:42.400 --> 00:48.790
So from the one angle it looks like a string but from the statistical point of view it may have a list

00:48.790 --> 00:50.400
number of unique values.

00:50.440 --> 00:57.190
So let's say about the sex column or let's say about the last column or even a relationship column even

00:57.210 --> 00:58.260
in occupation also.

00:58.270 --> 01:03.940
So there are a number of categorical columns that I really want you know it dataset particularly in

01:03.940 --> 01:05.090
this particular dataset.

01:05.170 --> 01:12.000
Because when you How was that kind of data set in that case you help to identify such a kind of column

01:12.360 --> 01:18.160
and you treat treated completely differently before applying for other machine learning related algorithm

01:18.400 --> 01:24.310
because you have to set your data set to another kind of encoding technique like a one time encoding

01:24.640 --> 01:28.160
or label encoding kind of technique you want to play on a double.

01:28.330 --> 01:34.750
So we are not going to go into detail of those kind of encoding but the idea is that you have to identify

01:35.020 --> 01:39.130
the column in which you are release the number of unique values that are available.

01:39.190 --> 01:41.040
Now hopefully you'll find that thing.

01:41.080 --> 01:48.460
So let's say about sex column based on our earlier knowledge we already know that it may have well not

01:48.460 --> 01:51.560
more than two columns or sometimes maximum three columns.

01:51.640 --> 01:57.520
So we can identify those things with dead bodies to make us like a and unique and a unique Microsoft.

01:58.000 --> 02:02.610
So let's grab the sex column first.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.690
And this is a serious matter.

02:04.720 --> 02:13.810
So this particular part will be done to see cities object and I'm just going to apply unique to my time

02:14.740 --> 02:19.560
so you can see Vio got the one which is having just a two way use.

02:19.600 --> 02:25.160
Now you can just see the first is that there is a little space one space after that.

02:25.210 --> 02:27.540
That is a mean space and then.

02:27.760 --> 02:30.190
So we'll just do unique values that are really.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.580
You can apply this land function to grab it.

02:33.580 --> 02:35.740
How many unique values that are relevant now.

02:35.740 --> 02:39.190
This exact result you can get fixed and unique.

02:39.250 --> 02:45.480
So instead of unique you can apply and you can equally turn exactly the similarity.

02:45.680 --> 02:50.760
Daniel played this land function on the top of the output of this particular design.

02:51.310 --> 02:56.510
So we'll identify that in a sex Leo just to do unique values that are relevant one is male and it's

02:56.640 --> 02:57.040
finished.

02:57.640 --> 03:03.120
Now let's grab for some other column so let's say the listenership.

03:03.300 --> 03:03.730
OK.

03:03.780 --> 03:04.330
This incident

03:07.540 --> 03:10.320
so we can grab like 20 if

03:17.060 --> 03:17.960
you like.

03:20.080 --> 03:26.230
So in relation second Silvio we're just five in six column one literally the same way.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.070
You know we can drive it let's say education

03:35.730 --> 03:43.870
and is very much helpful that if you have a lesser number of unique values that are really well you

03:43.870 --> 03:48.250
have to treat your data with some different kinds of technique.

03:48.310 --> 03:51.310
So we tell Bob this unique My Turn Eight will return there.

03:51.310 --> 03:54.770
How many unique and what are the unique values that are really.

03:55.030 --> 03:58.340
So in education columns Silvio quite some unique values.

03:58.420 --> 04:04.150
Now it doesn't make sense to apply this unique value on a real number because real numbers have infinite

04:04.150 --> 04:05.130
numbers of money.

04:05.170 --> 04:10.930
So it definitely won't make any kind of sense but let's say we will apply this unique on the top of

04:10.930 --> 04:11.910
this each column.

04:12.280 --> 04:25.540
So let's see how many we get a number equal return in each.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.530
Now you can see still we we're not very big number.

04:29.530 --> 04:34.740
Listen I'm so and unique militant 73 unique values that are relevant.

04:35.260 --> 04:41.820
OK so that is about the N unique matter and a unique matter which we can apply on top of this city's

04:41.830 --> 04:42.130
object.
