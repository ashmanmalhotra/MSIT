00:01.430 --> 00:02.390
Hi everyone.

00:02.480 --> 00:05.040
So let's see about that data type conversion.

00:05.060 --> 00:12.580
With the help of this not as type mater so we have taken this and I did not data not see as we filed

00:12.590 --> 00:14.030
for this particular video.

00:14.270 --> 00:15.680
So let me just executed.

00:16.650 --> 00:20.080
And let's see what is the data type of individual caller.

00:20.150 --> 00:29.270
So we are only learning data from attributes and amateur video that we can use this not in matter to

00:29.270 --> 00:32.450
declare individual column related information.

00:32.930 --> 00:40.200
So you can see the majority of column in our case it's the object type of column and demeaning all an

00:40.550 --> 00:48.050
integer 64 bit so data six there are six column which is in danger Miss column and remaining all the

00:48.620 --> 00:50.440
object based column.

00:50.450 --> 00:57.270
Now we haven't given any kind of information while leading this particular fight that bind us while

00:57.270 --> 01:02.710
reading this particular file you create this fuss over a column let's say eight treated like I in danger

01:03.410 --> 01:07.210
and then another column like a world class treated like an object.

01:07.250 --> 01:14.890
So as per the binders best ability I would say binders as assigned is based data type.

01:15.050 --> 01:19.300
What it can do individual column of other data every object.

01:19.850 --> 01:23.810
But it may happen that we are not satisfied with that.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.700
So let's say binders is any help providing some more data.

01:28.190 --> 01:32.380
So let's talk about the very same point where let's say sex.

01:32.480 --> 01:36.970
So we already know that the sex column has just the two sets of value.

01:36.980 --> 01:38.910
Either it will be a male or a female.

01:39.200 --> 01:45.470
So it doesn't make sense to put this particular column in The Object data type rather than that we can

01:45.470 --> 01:52.100
make it like a category kind of data type so category is nothing but when you want to encode a very

01:52.100 --> 01:57.590
lesser number of unique values that are really well in your particular features sorta column.

01:57.590 --> 02:01.320
In that case you have to use this category kind of call.

02:01.380 --> 02:08.030
Now while reading this particular file and put it into memory it has occupied three point seven plus

02:08.030 --> 02:09.380
megabytes of memory.

02:09.470 --> 02:18.110
So let's see Vi converting from object the sex column when we convert it into category kind of data

02:18.110 --> 02:20.900
type whether we can save some space or not.

02:21.380 --> 02:23.440
So let's first grab the sex column

02:26.940 --> 02:28.520
and let me just displayed first

02:31.340 --> 02:34.130
Yeah we have a linear object not a data object.

02:35.000 --> 02:43.760
So now you can see this mean mean and at the end of this city's data frame cities object we avoid data

02:43.760 --> 02:44.780
tables like an object.

02:44.780 --> 02:49.700
So we want to make this particular object as a category kind of data type.

02:50.490 --> 03:00.440
OK so far that we are going to use this as data matter and insight that we are going to apply this category.

03:00.530 --> 03:08.780
And let's see now if you observe here for the display purpose and for the visualization there is no

03:08.780 --> 03:14.370
change but in memory the way data has been presented earlier as object type.

03:14.480 --> 03:18.380
Now it has been presented as a date at a later category.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.280
So we just the two categories like a male and a female.

03:22.490 --> 03:29.720
So we can call it easily like a male is equal to zero or a female is equal to kind of 1 so that is the

03:29.720 --> 03:31.960
idea behind it in case of me.

03:31.970 --> 03:38.690
It was already occupying four character space and in case of female it is occupying the six character

03:38.690 --> 03:39.570
space.

03:39.740 --> 03:45.450
Now instead of the video just map those unique sets of value into one character space.

03:45.470 --> 03:51.140
So that's how we can reduce the space in our memory might still be balancing that how much memory will

03:51.140 --> 03:51.890
occupy.

03:51.890 --> 03:54.680
And we don't even assign it over original data.

03:54.890 --> 04:01.560
So I have to assign this C.D. to my what is it sex column.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.680
Okay and let me see.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.240
Sex.

04:05.810 --> 04:06.390
OK.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.960
Now let me just executed.

04:09.770 --> 04:12.970
And if you just apply let's say it for game.

04:15.410 --> 04:23.450
So now you can see here it was occupying three point seven plus megabytes of space in a memory.

04:23.450 --> 04:28.240
Now it is occupying three point five plus megabytes of memory.

04:28.250 --> 04:35.170
OK so you can see we'll reduce this amount of space required to represent the data by just converting

04:35.210 --> 04:38.260
our sex column from Object to what captivity.

04:38.360 --> 04:43.780
And if you observe this particular sex column information that earlier it was an object.

04:43.790 --> 04:45.150
Now it's OK.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.670
OK let's try it done another one.

04:47.690 --> 04:51.290
So let's say we have a marital status also.

04:51.320 --> 04:56.850
So marital status is also one less of number of unique values that are relevant.

04:56.870 --> 05:02.630
So I'm just copying the same quarter Leah and Lexie after that we can reduce it or not.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.540
So let's see magic done.

05:04.600 --> 05:12.260
I'm just going to select this medical status and I'm just re signing after conversion to a little additional

05:13.070 --> 05:19.270
color and let's drive it this fraud in flogging.

05:21.140 --> 05:27.260
Now you can see this marital status also become category and our memory uses also got reduced and it

05:27.260 --> 05:29.430
is reproducing so earlier.

05:29.560 --> 05:31.130
V O nine object column.

05:31.130 --> 05:36.570
Now Viola two category column and a seven object column because V O convert it to object column into

05:36.740 --> 05:43.430
category column and amount of space required in a memory also got continuously going down from three

05:43.430 --> 05:48.390
point seven in me space to three point five to three point three.

05:48.440 --> 05:54.370
So very very you feel that that is a list number of unique may lose out available in your data set.

05:54.560 --> 06:01.020
So in that case you can use such a kind of category data type and convert those data typing to get any.

06:01.070 --> 06:06.990
So this is about how you can convert into data instead of that you can convert something into a digital

06:06.990 --> 06:09.760
so you can convert it to float also.

06:09.770 --> 06:16.220
So as of now it doesn't make sense to convert any other thing into float or in danger but just for the

06:16.220 --> 06:23.060
illustration purposes let's say we want to convert this age from in danger to the float.

06:23.060 --> 06:27.230
So we are going to use the same s type matter.

06:27.740 --> 06:35.810
So let me just grab this age as right now I want to convert it into float.

06:36.260 --> 06:43.250
So I am just going to posit like a float and let me just assigning to the other original column like

06:43.250 --> 06:44.270
a page.

06:46.040 --> 06:48.470
OK and let me just add security.

06:49.010 --> 06:52.700
Now let's see what is the later type of individual content.

06:52.760 --> 06:59.270
Now as of now it is already in digits six people to meet and after converting into float again it is

06:59.270 --> 07:01.910
occupying the same space like a 64 bit.

07:01.910 --> 07:05.180
So it may happen in memory space.

07:05.180 --> 07:07.160
We have been reduced.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.650
So it's still three point three plus empty.

07:09.900 --> 07:14.140
By this age column is now float 64 bit.

07:14.930 --> 07:23.050
So we have a one float column two category column fine digital column an object kind of column is seven.

07:23.420 --> 07:29.390
So that is how you can do in the conversion of individual column from one day to day to another leader

07:29.430 --> 07:37.190
type with dental x type matter and after convoys and it may happen that your memory space might reduce

07:37.190 --> 07:38.740
or might increase also.

07:39.080 --> 07:46.100
So depending on taking some smart move you can reduce the amount of space required to represent your

07:46.100 --> 07:47.410
data in memory.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.140
OK.

07:48.170 --> 07:51.410
So that is all about that data type convert zone with Delta.

07:51.450 --> 07:53.070
This is not a state matter.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.310
On top of the different object.
