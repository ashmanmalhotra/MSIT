Hi everyone.

00:02.290 --> 00:07.900
So we have seen how to filter the data based on on one condition or based on the medical condition.

00:07.900 --> 00:12.760
Now let's see some more filtering matters available in the lead frame object.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.430
So we are going to use the same data frame object.

00:15.430 --> 00:17.770
Let me just display for speed records.

00:18.880 --> 00:23.910
OK now let's say our condition to filter the data may be something like.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.780
Let's concentrate on.

00:25.930 --> 00:28.420
I would say education let's say.

00:28.420 --> 00:32.900
So let's see how many unique values out there in the education column.

00:32.920 --> 00:38.050
So I'm going to use this unique matter education.

00:38.170 --> 00:40.100
It will return a C.D. object.

00:40.120 --> 00:45.340
And on top of that we are going to supply a unique network.

00:45.550 --> 00:48.800
And it will return home a unique value that any education.

00:49.060 --> 00:49.300
OK.

00:49.330 --> 00:57.110
So we have total either nominee total but somewhere around 10 to 15 unique values that are valuable

00:57.160 --> 00:58.130
in education.

00:58.510 --> 01:08.180
So now let's say our requirement is we want to try all those records which is having our education column.

01:08.180 --> 01:16.540
Either it will be a 11th grade or it be a masters or let's say it will be a 12th grade.

01:16.550 --> 01:21.330
So either it will be a 11th grade it will be 12th grade or it will be a master.

01:21.350 --> 01:23.340
So how we can approach this problem.

01:23.360 --> 01:28.560
So one thing we can do it like we can create a three different condition.

01:28.610 --> 01:33.800
So say maybe you created earlier and we can combine all those condition with help of putting a patient

01:33.810 --> 01:38.000
so let's say we'll create one condition like a common one.

01:38.300 --> 01:48.500
And I'm just going to use later this year for education and I will gesticulating Victor this 11.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.960
Now I have one space also available here.

01:51.220 --> 01:58.030
So this type of people accessing data leading has to be done before applying such a kind of operation

01:58.090 --> 02:00.080
to get some insight from your data.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.170
OK.

02:01.180 --> 02:03.670
So this is one condition.

02:03.730 --> 02:13.210
Let me just copy as well like Id gone to let's say on three and eleven and then there is a great great

02:13.210 --> 02:13.620
answer.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.500
And one is like a master.

02:17.390 --> 02:22.610
OK no I have to execute.

02:22.630 --> 02:25.380
So now we've got a three condition.

02:25.420 --> 02:32.730
I can simply combine this conditions like a common one and then type symbol.

02:32.800 --> 02:39.820
This is for the order operation gone by symbol and country.

02:39.820 --> 02:47.260
Now you can see whatever the result of V O God where education column which is having only these three

02:47.260 --> 02:55.500
value only either Lindsay Lohan master level and delivery master and then view in God is any thing like

02:55.500 --> 02:55.940
a twelve.

02:56.080 --> 02:56.680
Yeah.

02:56.860 --> 02:58.780
At the end of this day I said we are got.

02:59.140 --> 03:01.850
So apart from that all other values got freedom.

03:02.380 --> 03:11.060
But let's say you want to grab some more few values apart from this master let's say associated academic

03:11.070 --> 03:13.470
or associated VOC or so you want to reflect.

03:13.540 --> 03:16.660
So you have to keep creating such a kind of condition.

03:16.810 --> 03:24.960
But this insane matter what I just highlighted here at the starting of this video which gives the easy

03:24.960 --> 03:26.160
solution for it.

03:26.160 --> 03:37.690
So what we can do we can apply this easing on the top of this education column.

03:37.830 --> 03:38.470
Easy.

03:40.630 --> 03:41.430
Oh sorry.

03:41.730 --> 03:44.080
Easy.

03:44.120 --> 03:45.180
So this is the easy.

03:45.290 --> 03:51.550
Now inside that I can parse all those list of value what I want to try.

03:51.860 --> 03:54.670
So I hope to reclaim the three values.

03:54.680 --> 04:07.970
So the first one is like a lemon.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.020
And then that is a much.

04:12.660 --> 04:13.150
OK.

04:13.230 --> 04:18.770
So what it will do it will return only those that is a variable education column.

04:18.780 --> 04:24.400
It will find either one of three values so what it will return.

04:24.400 --> 04:32.350
It will return only to its record in which it will find out in a column particularly in education column

04:32.860 --> 04:36.940
having a value either element or request or a master.

04:36.970 --> 04:43.300
So we search for that particular column education and if variable it finds that either one of these

04:43.600 --> 04:50.500
three value either one of the three values from this particular list it will return only to slacker.

04:50.500 --> 04:55.350
So let me just executed so it has written only falls through.

04:55.400 --> 05:01.760
Now I can just grab this thing as a condition in a bracket notation of this layer object.

05:02.720 --> 05:09.700
So now you can see education is having a lemon M. the same data frame you got to try.

05:10.020 --> 05:17.350
So the beauty here is that instead of creating precondition and putting auditing across all three conditions

05:17.600 --> 05:24.320
we can just simply use like our ease in matter and supply all those will do for that particular column

05:24.470 --> 05:25.750
which we want to right.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.720
So it will just return only true and false.

05:28.760 --> 05:32.870
And we can just make it condition and supply to the of object.

05:33.530 --> 05:36.290
OK so that is about the in matter.

05:36.290 --> 05:39.650
Let's see in the next video some more filtering matters.
