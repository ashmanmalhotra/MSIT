Hi everyone.

00:02.790 --> 00:09.530
So let's see how we can randomly sample some portion of your personal data frame object.

00:09.900 --> 00:13.250
So let me just execute this had I not.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.580
Did I not see this we.

00:15.270 --> 00:19.980
Now why we need to do such a kind of random sampling.

00:19.980 --> 00:25.890
So sometimes in your use case you need to randomly select some sort of lay down you want to analyze

00:25.890 --> 00:26.100
it.

00:26.400 --> 00:27.930
So that is a one use case.

00:27.960 --> 00:34.110
Sometimes when you're working with any kind of predictive modeling that related algorithm.

00:34.140 --> 00:39.320
So in that case most likely you need to divide your data into two different chunks of data.

00:39.330 --> 00:42.570
Let's say training sets up data diner testing sets of data.

00:42.690 --> 00:49.740
So you apply your algorithm on a training sets of data create your model and apply this data on your

00:50.160 --> 00:51.210
newly created money.

00:51.600 --> 00:58.650
So in such a kind of situation you need to randomly sample some data and that data for object provides

00:58.650 --> 01:00.910
us one sample function.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.090
So let me execute this thing.

01:03.090 --> 01:10.380
I guess I'll execute it OK and let us verify for school records first.

01:10.380 --> 01:11.350
Now let's see.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.360
And let's see how many first records are really but.

01:14.640 --> 01:21.540
So we are going to use this land function and we can just simply pass literally if so we'll total 32000

01:21.600 --> 01:24.030
560 six records out of it.

01:24.240 --> 01:30.280
Now let's say if you want to randomly choose one particular records or not particular because any number

01:30.330 --> 01:38.160
records so we can use later sample matter and we are going to discuss here the two different arguments

01:38.160 --> 01:39.840
associated with this particular function.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.840
So let's just see the documentation.

01:41.880 --> 01:47.850
So the first one is the n which is indicating that how many total number of item are random item you

01:47.850 --> 01:51.180
want to try from your ordinary data frame object.

01:51.180 --> 01:53.290
And the second argument is like a fraction.

01:53.340 --> 01:56.880
So how much fractions of your data you want to grab.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.850
So that is not dependent on any hardcoded value.

02:00.030 --> 02:06.510
Well let's say you want to read 30 percent of your whole data frame object or 1 percent only of your

02:06.510 --> 02:07.670
full data frame object.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.240
So in that case you can use this Frank argument.

02:10.470 --> 02:11.610
OK let's try it.

02:11.910 --> 02:12.720
And first.

02:12.990 --> 02:14.720
So let's say N is for logistic one.

02:14.730 --> 02:23.130
So I just want to grab one randomly sample data from our total 32000 561 records.

02:24.330 --> 02:30.340
So it has return as the final record was indexing thirty one thousand seventy six.

02:30.390 --> 02:32.470
Let's execute this thing again.

02:32.610 --> 02:39.270
So we all got done at the record every time you execute you will get done and the records.

02:39.320 --> 02:41.550
Let's try it instead of 1.

02:41.550 --> 02:44.760
Let's say you want to grab let's say four records.

02:44.910 --> 02:49.150
So for randomly sent by value it will returns.

02:49.530 --> 02:49.840
OK.

02:49.860 --> 02:51.670
Now let's drive down that argument.

02:52.140 --> 02:59.850
Let's say you want to grab one percentage of data so you can pass this frac value.

02:59.850 --> 03:03.410
Now this frac value is varying from 0 to 1.

03:03.420 --> 03:07.100
That how much in terms of fraction you want to grab the data.

03:07.110 --> 03:12.210
Let's say you want to grab the data one percentage of your full data frame object.

03:12.210 --> 03:14.130
So in that case you're two puzzling on one.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.020
Divide the hundred which is zero point zero one.

03:18.060 --> 03:25.880
If you just look and let us displayed so you can see it as returned as number of different records.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.060
Man Let's see how many records it has done.

03:29.760 --> 03:32.700
Total to 26 Rosie does return.

03:32.760 --> 03:39.160
That means that Aveo reclaimed one percentage of data out of our total 32000.

03:39.290 --> 03:45.780
Some records were available which is nothing but the full 100 percent of your data or you want to be

03:45.780 --> 03:47.280
able to say 10 percentage of data.

03:47.280 --> 03:53.180
So in that case you can use like a 0 to 1 which is equivalent to 10 percent each.

03:53.190 --> 03:59.790
So now you really get something like a three thousand I guess yeah three thousand two hundred fifty

03:59.790 --> 04:00.350
six.

04:00.360 --> 04:07.080
So in this way you can use these two arguments to randomly get some portion of your DNA.

04:07.230 --> 04:08.040
They definitely object.
