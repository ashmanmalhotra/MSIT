00:00.940 --> 00:01.940
Hi everyone.

00:01.990 --> 00:07.630
So we have seen how to filter the data based on some sort of comparison operator.

00:07.660 --> 00:13.330
Now really combine this multiple companies and operator will combine those conditions with even hardly

00:13.330 --> 00:15.980
one logical operator like high end and our operator.

00:16.300 --> 00:20.710
And we'll see how we can filter the data into my dismal condition.

00:20.710 --> 00:26.100
So we have already created multiple conditions in the last two videos so let's say one can this end

00:26.110 --> 00:29.190
is something like sex is a mean.

00:29.350 --> 00:39.180
So let's grab the data where the sex column is a male and all the age value will be greater than 50.

00:39.220 --> 00:46.210
So they try only to recall where the sex column is made and is greater than 50.

00:46.240 --> 00:53.560
So let's create a condition and really combine both of this condition with some sort of ending operator.

00:53.830 --> 00:56.290
So let me just copy it.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.410
So this is the first condition.

00:59.410 --> 01:01.790
So I am just going to view the name like a con.

01:01.810 --> 01:14.260
So it is equal to condition one and that one is lexicon to condition to sort of age 50.

01:14.620 --> 01:17.500
OK so you created a condition.

01:17.500 --> 01:22.500
Let me just display on one and 2.

01:22.720 --> 01:25.300
So true and con.

01:25.930 --> 01:26.780
OK.

01:26.820 --> 01:30.030
Now let me just collapse this back.

01:30.130 --> 01:32.640
Now we need to retract those data.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.030
They bought of the condition so get satisfied.

01:37.390 --> 01:42.710
So we are going to supply inside the F so first condition is like on 1.

01:42.790 --> 01:50.180
So it will only require those that core business having a value male in a sex column and that is going

01:50.260 --> 01:51.080
to.

01:51.190 --> 01:56.650
And most of the condition meaning combined with and operator now and operator.

01:56.680 --> 02:03.780
We already know as a programmer that if Mourdock of this condition got satisfy then lately they're going

02:03.820 --> 02:04.930
to resign.

02:05.140 --> 02:08.690
So let me just bring some fuel that goes on.

02:08.860 --> 02:20.330
Let's the head held on to and let me bring on one head that is had made it is very useful when you're

02:20.350 --> 02:26.770
actually working with the data analysis because every since now and then you hope to seat your data

02:27.070 --> 02:34.000
and plus find out cause it will immediately give you now you can see only that Corbett is having a next

02:34.000 --> 02:37.590
number three where only most of this value will be true.

02:37.780 --> 02:44.920
Otherwise at least one false will do so it will be on this face and we can even first come by here also

02:45.270 --> 02:48.530
with ending operation in corn.

02:49.090 --> 02:57.560
Now let let me just create this brand and I will like Palmetto so it will just say can we first base

02:57.600 --> 02:57.820
it.

02:58.300 --> 03:04.810
OK so only record of it is having a third or index number clean it is having a value too.

03:04.930 --> 03:07.530
So it will just recline only those so-called.

03:07.750 --> 03:17.770
Now let me apply this both of the condition to get the date of any object and now you can see the total

03:17.770 --> 03:23.290
recall only from our first fight or only Total Recall it has come like if you observe the result you

03:23.290 --> 03:28.570
can see all are male only an eighty side greater than 50 only.

03:29.020 --> 03:36.490
OK now let's say there is no hard condition that the present order data should be having a mean and

03:36.490 --> 03:43.710
it should be having age greater than 50 instead of date either one of them got satisfied with me cookie.

03:43.720 --> 03:51.130
So in that case me are to lose the order of operations so you're going to use the second one on two

03:51.880 --> 03:55.290
and he'll be became like a pipe symbol.

03:55.380 --> 04:01.590
Notice generally this pipe symbol will be available just near to your end turkey on your keyboard.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.090
Now let me just executed.

04:03.850 --> 04:08.780
So now you can see a lot of male only the old guard familia.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.860
We got a female also but variable there is a female.

04:11.860 --> 04:13.540
It has to be a greater than 50 only.

04:13.550 --> 04:17.080
So I drove from one condition has to satisfy.

04:17.170 --> 04:19.870
So either both of the conditions will get satisfied.

04:19.870 --> 04:24.880
So in a first case we adjust the male condition got satisfied but age is less than 50.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.090
In our second case also it's a mean less than 50.

04:28.120 --> 04:31.860
What I would say equal to 50 but it's not a greater than 50.

04:31.870 --> 04:35.160
In this particular case male and greater than 50.

04:35.290 --> 04:41.280
So either one of them condition got satisfied and based on that it is required that is it.

04:41.350 --> 04:44.430
So this way you can combine those kind of condition.

04:44.500 --> 04:50.710
You can even come none none other condition Victor even under a complex statement let's say will create

04:50.710 --> 04:57.860
another third one let's let let let me create.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.520
Let me see first few records.

05:05.230 --> 05:12.200
So we have all education also available so we can create a third condition let's say on the.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.840
And Viola educations would be must be bachelors only.

05:16.870 --> 05:21.010
So let's say let's skip the heart condition legal education

05:26.800 --> 05:28.630
and let me just copy.

05:30.760 --> 05:34.270
Ok so current condition or so we'll create it.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.150
Now we can combine these multiple conditions together.

05:37.420 --> 05:45.040
So let's say we want to get the result that data which is having a education must be a bachelor at least

05:45.040 --> 05:51.850
must be a bachelor whether it is greater than 50 years of age if it is then it's also ok if it is not

05:52.090 --> 05:53.340
then it's also ok.

05:53.380 --> 06:02.950
So conditioned to got something like EMI deal so you can combine this on one and lexicon two and you

06:02.960 --> 06:06.460
can deciding it so there's no yard requirement.

06:06.510 --> 06:09.770
You can combine all those two conditions.

06:10.140 --> 06:16.860
So now you can see either this condition got to satisfy or either this condition got to satisfy it has

06:16.860 --> 06:17.370
let it out.

06:17.370 --> 06:20.890
That is so conditioned please Laker the.

06:21.090 --> 06:26.550
So now you can see wherever there is a bachelor it might happen that this condition one in condition

06:27.290 --> 06:28.920
two got five songs.

06:29.280 --> 06:37.320
OK so that is a lack of logic circuit related stuff that is based on your logic my my idea here is to

06:37.320 --> 06:40.640
introduce that how you can filter that data up is done.

06:40.690 --> 06:41.670
My given condition.
