00:01.670 --> 00:02.580
Hi everyone.

00:02.660 --> 00:06.890
So let's see one more method of this filtering of your data.

00:07.010 --> 00:09.640
As we've seen in last week you like using matter.

00:09.650 --> 00:12.240
There is another matter Laker between matter.

00:12.410 --> 00:17.090
Let's display fossil fuel that of this data frame object.

00:17.120 --> 00:19.320
Now how does between matter.

00:19.580 --> 00:26.400
So let's consider the scenario like let's say you want to find all those record was easiest like let's

00:26.500 --> 00:27.970
say greater than 40.

00:28.370 --> 00:30.980
But less than 60.

00:30.980 --> 00:36.070
So how we can approach is we can create a condition where condition 1 will be a.

00:36.200 --> 00:41.790
Each will be greater than 40 and their condition will be it will be less than 60.

00:41.810 --> 00:46.650
You can combine these two condition with that and operation and it will require no reason.

00:47.210 --> 00:53.240
So instead of doing all those kinds of hurdle you can just simply use this between matter.

00:53.780 --> 00:56.660
So we are not going to go with that hardly.

00:56.720 --> 01:03.590
As I already explained in the last video that combining multiple condition to get that this easy in

01:03.620 --> 01:07.750
operation and between how it played out will be very helpful respectively.

01:07.760 --> 01:12.140
We'll try to replace this heart operation and operation.

01:12.550 --> 01:12.930
OK.

01:13.010 --> 01:20.320
So let's try to grab those results where the age is greater than 40 and less than 60.

01:20.660 --> 01:21.080
OK.

01:21.140 --> 01:28.470
So we are going to apply this condition on top of this each column.

01:28.500 --> 01:35.390
Now this between is nothing but it's a serious matter it's not a data matter.

01:35.390 --> 01:42.500
So keep those thing in mind that we are applying in a one of the column of this data frame object and

01:42.500 --> 01:46.780
that column here is nothing but a series object not only the frame object.

01:47.100 --> 01:51.840
So between and here we are going to supply the two argument.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.220
So first one is the start and end kind of.

01:55.430 --> 01:58.790
So in greater than 40 I mean in less than 60.

01:59.960 --> 02:04.400
Let me just executed so you can see somewhere I got 5 Central.

02:04.610 --> 02:09.800
So between all those 80 which is between 40 and 60 it has returned true.

02:10.490 --> 02:17.450
So you can see the second is 50 that's why it is returned to apart from that t lower than a second mode

02:17.450 --> 02:21.090
of the case it has returned to finds because it is less than 40.

02:21.110 --> 02:27.520
Let me just apply in say the brackets.

02:27.530 --> 02:35.060
Now we can observe all those kinds of each so age ages 50 53 49.

02:35.340 --> 02:42.830
Let us narrow down this particular lead so we get much more idea let's say between 40 and 40 only we

02:42.850 --> 02:43.160
want.

02:43.360 --> 02:43.940
OK.

02:44.200 --> 02:50.390
So you can see all those recorded as retry where it is between 40 and 42.

02:50.440 --> 02:56.250
So it has exclusively and it is 42 also so 40 41 and 42.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.690
Well you only you will get in each column.

02:58.750 --> 03:02.830
Now you can apply this matter on top of some M related data also.

03:03.040 --> 03:08.650
So let's say you want to grab the data between from the start date and between some end date.

03:08.650 --> 03:13.460
So in that case it will the cloud based on those and they object also.

03:13.480 --> 03:19.520
Now in our dataset we don't have any kind of daytime object so you can experiment with different data

03:19.520 --> 03:26.850
set and you can try to retrain only those that are caught between some range start dating.

03:27.070 --> 03:34.270
And let me get my idea here is to introduce you date how this between matter works on the top of this

03:34.540 --> 03:41.680
series object so you do not need to write that much detail condition and combine those multiple conditions

03:41.680 --> 03:44.680
with and operation to get your desired result.

03:45.170 --> 03:45.450
OK.

03:45.460 --> 03:47.410
So that is all about the between matter.
