Hi everyone.

00:02.550 --> 00:07.620
So we've seen how to create a data frame object from the dot CSP file.

00:08.010 --> 00:11.820
And we've seen what other attributes and a you can apply on top of it.

00:12.390 --> 00:19.380
So we have already imported this particular ideal dart data not CSP file and I just pasted the same

00:19.380 --> 00:19.980
code.

00:20.010 --> 00:24.290
So let me just display first few records.

00:26.030 --> 00:30.550
So I'm just going to display do course here.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.540
So we'll total 15 columns that are relevant.

00:33.620 --> 00:38.180
Now let's say if you want to add some new column how we do it.

00:38.840 --> 00:45.590
So let let us take a example let's say these are all fictitious one column we are going to pay.

00:45.710 --> 00:52.790
It has no meaning or it doesn't make any sense to add it but just to give you technical detail how you

00:52.790 --> 00:56.530
could add it all up like a human being here only.

00:56.540 --> 01:06.610
So we are going to add one column like that say the name will be kind of spaces.

01:07.640 --> 01:08.890
OK.

01:10.010 --> 01:13.310
And we can just simply assign like all other human being.

01:17.000 --> 01:17.510
OK.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.370
Now what happens here.

01:19.380 --> 01:27.170
That it will create a brand new different column and it will assign for every single record the human

01:27.170 --> 01:28.540
meat kind of story.

01:29.180 --> 01:31.150
So let me just it.

01:32.690 --> 01:34.880
And if I just paint it again

01:37.730 --> 01:40.190
like two records let's say let me just do it.

01:40.340 --> 01:46.490
Goes so you can see at the end the kind of spaces that human beings all are human.

01:46.970 --> 01:53.630
You can see about every single record has been added with a new column like kind of Scorsese's human

01:53.630 --> 01:58.040
meat let's say a somewhat more meaningful one want to make.

01:58.040 --> 02:05.060
So we have a first column available like a each and that is a digital 64 bit type of column.

02:05.120 --> 02:11.720
So all those numbers are available inside this H column model pages in years.

02:11.750 --> 02:20.090
Now let's say if you want to make another column where it is will be a months so we can just create

02:20.090 --> 02:21.290
another column let's say

02:24.430 --> 02:30.760
age and just like a each in once.

02:30.840 --> 02:31.510
Okay.

02:31.730 --> 02:40.180
And let me this assign it our original column like a b f each.

02:40.250 --> 02:42.800
Now how to grab this particular column.

02:42.940 --> 02:48.620
We are going to see somewhat in a more detail in the next video that how you can select one particular

02:48.620 --> 02:49.190
column.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.420
Order more than one particular column.

02:51.500 --> 02:58.130
So I'm just going to select as each column and multiply every single value in this particular age of

02:58.130 --> 02:58.710
my twins.

02:59.060 --> 03:04.490
And I'm just going to assign it with our newly created column Laker in a month.

03:04.490 --> 03:05.840
So let me just execute it.

03:06.740 --> 03:11.400
OK then let's just display as food and course.

03:11.450 --> 03:14.450
So let's say two records you are two displayed.

03:15.480 --> 03:16.070
OK.

03:16.220 --> 03:23.570
So now you can see the viola another column has been created like a page in a month so text 9 8 has

03:23.570 --> 03:28.070
been translated to for 68 months for these.

03:28.430 --> 03:31.760
It has been translated to 600 months.

03:31.790 --> 03:35.000
So this way you can create a new column.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.100
So first we all created a new column in video assign to completely constant string.

03:40.430 --> 03:48.380
And in the next video created a new column and we'll drive the value of that new column from the already

03:48.400 --> 03:49.810
existing column.

03:49.820 --> 03:57.920
Now if you will just look at the if not saved you can see earlier we have a 15 column now v over 17

03:57.920 --> 04:05.240
column because two newly added column V O I need with some sort of logic and computation.

04:05.490 --> 04:06.830
OK see you in the next video.
