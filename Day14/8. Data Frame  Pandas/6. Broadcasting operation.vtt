00:00.950 --> 00:01.990
Hi everyone.

00:02.090 --> 00:07.160
So let's see some of the broadcasting operation we can apply on top of this data stream object.

00:07.610 --> 00:11.360
So let me just display first few records of data offering.

00:11.930 --> 00:18.200
So this had method is very much helpful just to give you a glance at what your data looks like.

00:18.470 --> 00:26.190
So now let's say you want to apply let's say to each of every single employee of every single angle

00:26.360 --> 00:29.830
containing about it as a Laker addition of five.

00:30.050 --> 00:37.310
So it doesn't make sense but it may happen that your business use case you may need to do such a kind

00:37.310 --> 00:46.280
of operation so we can use like a leaf cake as we have seen in the earlier video last video that the

00:46.320 --> 00:46.960
FH.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.220
We can just simply supply them near each plus fine.

00:50.780 --> 00:59.170
So now it looks like we're confusing that we're trying to add this column plus by now what does it mean.

00:59.270 --> 01:06.850
Because this is particularly full CDC twin rating and now plus pi indicates that every single cause

01:06.860 --> 01:09.650
of that particular cities we are going to add five.

01:10.010 --> 01:11.480
So now let's.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.550
Rather than assigning to this each column.

01:14.660 --> 01:18.560
Let me just execute it and see what it really does.

01:18.590 --> 01:23.320
So thirty nine become 44 50 become 50 fight and you fight.

01:23.320 --> 01:27.080
Just try to assign it let's say each and

01:29.810 --> 01:34.000
every single age value VBA picking my fight.

01:34.040 --> 01:36.440
Now let's do this head again.

01:39.410 --> 01:44.310
So now you can see 39 become 44 and 50 become 55.

01:44.360 --> 01:50.660
So that is the kind of broadcasting operation that once you do all those kinds of arithmetic it will

01:50.660 --> 01:56.080
be applied on every single course available in your data set or in your data fleet.

01:56.780 --> 02:01.130
Let's say you want to multiply this F and elevate an education number.

02:01.160 --> 02:04.670
It doesn't make sense at this moment but let's try to do it.

02:04.820 --> 02:09.980
So let's say I'm trying to grab us our final rate

02:13.760 --> 02:15.980
and another column is like RDF

02:18.920 --> 02:20.310
in new number.

02:23.290 --> 02:26.620
And if I just execute it it will be multiplied.

02:26.620 --> 02:30.110
So seventy seven thousand 561 516.

02:30.310 --> 02:31.510
Multiply by Turkey.

02:32.150 --> 02:32.980
OK.

02:33.010 --> 02:37.900
So let me just call up stout but let's ease couple of more.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.290
Let's say we have our hours per week.

02:40.300 --> 02:46.840
So each employee has done this much although support per week but after that we found that everyone

02:46.840 --> 02:50.430
has done some two hours of overtime.

02:50.440 --> 02:56.500
And if you want to update this particular column let's say powers but VK so we can just simply call

02:56.590 --> 02:58.720
it let's say the f

03:01.810 --> 03:02.730
I'm going to updated

03:07.070 --> 03:15.000
my early to put two hours of overtime deal then every single week.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.820
So perfectly executed.

03:17.190 --> 03:18.210
Let's see the result.

03:21.930 --> 03:23.390
So earlier it was a 40.

03:23.390 --> 03:26.790
Now become 42 and 13 become 50.

03:27.270 --> 03:32.000
So this is the kind of broadcasting operation we can supply on it.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.730
Let's see the capital gain.

03:33.750 --> 03:42.270
So let's say capital gain whatever gain will be each individual employee has a squawk let's say you

03:42.270 --> 03:45.240
want to divide it by let's say five.

03:46.950 --> 03:53.090
So now 2 1 7 4 has been divided by five will become four active four.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.400
Let me just call up six.

03:54.860 --> 04:00.990
OK so this is about the broadcasting of this and that all those kinds of mathematical manipulation you

04:00.990 --> 04:03.780
can apply on individual column itself.

04:03.780 --> 04:09.420
So it will be applied on eventually every single course available in your column.

04:09.420 --> 04:09.630
OK.

04:09.650 --> 04:14.070
So that is all about the broadcasting of it and I hope you enjoy listening to Syria and see the next

04:14.070 --> 04:14.330
video.
