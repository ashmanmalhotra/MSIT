00:01.300 --> 00:02.390
Hi everyone.

00:02.500 --> 00:08.200
So let's see how we can drop some missing Rose or missing values a really well in a data frame object

00:08.230 --> 00:10.180
or some column.

00:10.180 --> 00:16.270
This is having a missing value so to illustrate the concept of this missing value and some function

00:16.270 --> 00:22.600
we are going to use on the top of this data frame object like a drop banner and drop any I have created

00:22.660 --> 00:28.930
one data frame object which is having a some arbitrary value and majority of values are like a and b

00:28.940 --> 00:36.760
dart and then and then is a special way of indicating that this is not the number and we'll use this

00:36.760 --> 00:39.250
particular attribute from the NUM by lately.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.850
So no library I already imported earlier.

00:42.160 --> 00:47.000
So if you aren't important you have to import it while executing this particular statement.

00:47.020 --> 00:55.120
So I have created this data from this data and the column name I listed later ABC.

00:55.480 --> 00:59.920
So let me just execute it and we create the data frame object first.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.700
Okay let's display where the f object.

01:03.970 --> 01:06.820
So we have a total four rows and a four column.

01:06.820 --> 01:12.850
Now if you observe your major duty of rose up and n so n n is a special way of indicating that is a

01:12.850 --> 01:14.670
missing value inside data.

01:15.130 --> 01:25.850
So we are going to use one function on top of this data frame object like a drop any so drop not a number.

01:26.500 --> 01:33.740
So many times while analyzing your data you might face the situations like if you if you had a having

01:33.740 --> 01:40.330
a some kind of missing value in any row or column label you have to remove that particular rows or column

01:40.330 --> 01:41.470
respectively.

01:41.470 --> 01:49.490
So let's see the documentation of this drop any so if you see it exists and how so we're going to play

01:49.570 --> 01:59.440
it mainly this two parameter like Xs and how so Xs can have a two values like a CDO or one so zeros

01:59.480 --> 02:03.210
corresponding to rollover and one is corresponding to column Lewin.

02:03.350 --> 02:12.200
So at a column loop it will consider and another one is later how so how is also two values like any

02:12.680 --> 02:15.890
or all so default values.

02:16.260 --> 02:19.270
So let's try to put it into practice.

02:19.530 --> 02:22.800
So let's say at a rally when we want to apply this thing.

02:22.980 --> 02:31.860
So we are going to supply X this is equal to zero and let's say how you want to remove anything so let's

02:31.860 --> 02:39.570
say n so it indicates that at the Raleigh Well if you find any of the record it is having at least any

02:39.570 --> 02:44.190
value none are not a number or a missing value you just discard it.

02:44.190 --> 02:50.840
So now you can see every single course you can try to visualize this thing horizontal.

02:50.940 --> 02:58.770
So every single that caused this one first and then this one every single decoders at least one missing.

02:59.050 --> 03:03.410
So what it will do it will just discard every single records.

03:03.460 --> 03:10.670
So we got almost zero records no output and it has returned as that data frame which is having no records

03:10.690 --> 03:11.220
at all.

03:12.010 --> 03:13.600
Let's try it all.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.670
Another parameter at a rollover.

03:16.210 --> 03:18.460
So instead of any let's say on.

03:19.560 --> 03:25.990
So all indicates that if you observe every single value is missing in that particular record then oddly

03:26.110 --> 03:27.090
discarded.

03:27.130 --> 03:28.860
So let us execute.

03:28.900 --> 03:34.570
So now you can see the full track record which is having index number three has been discarded remaining.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.780
All of that could remain as it is in output.

03:37.780 --> 03:45.790
Now what are the output we got from this drop any function it has returned as the brand new data frame

03:45.850 --> 03:52.300
object but if you just display the ordinary data frame the change is not permanent.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.700
Still we got our original data fully.

03:54.760 --> 04:00.310
That means whatever the change and a modification with help of this drop any function what we have applied

04:00.310 --> 04:06.280
on a level additional data that does not mean taking place into our or is null object.

04:06.850 --> 04:09.520
So far that we will learn about the in-place parameter.

04:09.760 --> 04:15.130
So same in place parameter what we are learning a c e object that will be applied on a data frame object

04:15.130 --> 04:15.370
also.

04:15.370 --> 04:18.250
So those things will seem to some future videos.

04:18.250 --> 04:24.760
So as of now without this in place parameter it has returned as the brand new data every object we can

04:24.760 --> 04:26.060
assign it to the same.

04:26.230 --> 04:30.860
But our objective here is not to assign and create a new data frame object.

04:30.940 --> 04:33.940
Just observe that is based on the different parameters.

04:34.120 --> 04:40.320
So this thing will applied in Raleigh with Now let's apply it to column one.

04:40.570 --> 04:44.410
So instead of x is equal to zero let's say x is equal to 1.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.410
And how you want to do it.

04:47.620 --> 04:53.290
So any of the records having a none value or a missing value just discarded.

04:54.070 --> 04:57.640
So every single column has at least one value.

04:57.700 --> 04:58.620
It is a missing.

04:58.620 --> 05:02.170
That's why it has discarded every single column.

05:02.290 --> 05:08.740
Let's do Victor any instead of any let's try it all

05:11.720 --> 05:15.040
so now you can imaging which particular column will be discarded.

05:15.230 --> 05:21.050
So here the sea column sea column has every single record which the missing.

05:21.050 --> 05:23.120
That means that only will be discarded.

05:23.120 --> 05:29.930
Apart from that this column has at least one value it is not missing me has a true value it is not missing

05:30.260 --> 05:33.550
and it has also two value is it three values is not missing.

05:33.800 --> 05:34.850
So each one we discarded.

05:35.150 --> 05:36.670
So let's see the result.

05:36.710 --> 05:39.820
So as expected the column C has been removed.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.910
Now this thing happens.

05:43.030 --> 05:44.170
Dysfunction.

05:44.190 --> 05:50.010
You can apply whenever you find some missing mail you are not on a mark of value.

05:50.010 --> 05:56.120
Now let's say in part you already know that some of the rules what are some of the columns you anyhow

05:56.130 --> 05:59.450
one to discarded independent of any criteria.

05:59.820 --> 06:07.050
So whether it has a missing rose or a missing column or missing values inside that particular hole are

06:07.080 --> 06:09.500
missing values in that particular column.

06:09.570 --> 06:13.500
You don't want to include that in your further analysis.

06:13.500 --> 06:22.140
So in that case you have to use the function like a drop instead of drop any so it lets that apply data

06:22.390 --> 06:24.630
but only with so little.

06:24.630 --> 06:29.380
Now before that let me just bring this overall regional data.

06:29.940 --> 06:31.540
So yes.

06:31.860 --> 06:35.150
Now at a really well beach other rows you want to misguided.

06:35.490 --> 06:42.630
So for that we have a one attribute what we can some place later levies and let's say we want to remove

06:44.180 --> 06:45.770
the index number bodies like a tool.

06:46.730 --> 06:52.120
So we have got to return like a zero row first row and turtle.

06:52.910 --> 06:55.720
Okay so index number is like a 0 1 and 2.

06:55.940 --> 07:00.090
It has the return is this second number is and has been removed.

07:00.230 --> 07:06.820
We can even supply like 2 and 3 so 0 and 1 only it will be return.

07:06.830 --> 07:10.350
Now let's say let's apply the same function into column labor.

07:10.640 --> 07:17.040
So if talk can drop so let's say x is equal to 1.

07:17.060 --> 07:23.200
Now when you want to drop some particular column in that case you how to parse the parameters later

07:23.330 --> 07:27.970
column and which are the column you want to discard it.

07:28.250 --> 07:37.340
So let's say I want to discard the B so compare to be double ordinal data from the F and see the result

07:37.550 --> 07:40.440
and see the comparison output.

07:41.120 --> 07:42.590
So B has been discarded.

07:42.590 --> 07:49.550
You want to decide let's say B also so e and see only will be right.

07:49.850 --> 07:56.150
So in this way independent of any missing values across the row or column with type of draft function

07:56.180 --> 08:03.140
you can drop individual rows or a column and you have to supply those index number corresponding to

08:03.140 --> 08:05.090
rows and column.

08:05.090 --> 08:08.030
OK so that is all about this video see you in the next video.
