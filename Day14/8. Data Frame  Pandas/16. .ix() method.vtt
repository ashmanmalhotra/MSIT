00:00.550 --> 00:04.320
All right everyone so let's see about the night I expected.

00:04.360 --> 00:10.890
So we already learn how to drive the individual loads of information in a last video with the help of

00:10.900 --> 00:13.630
not locked my car and not I locked metal.

00:13.630 --> 00:20.920
Now this object too of this I use method is also exactly similar but that is a one difference is that

00:21.160 --> 00:28.800
this i.e. X matter will take care of most positional base argument plus label based argument or positional

00:28.810 --> 00:31.170
based indexing and a label based indexing mode.

00:31.510 --> 00:40.780
So we're already loaded of a data frame in a last studio like data of objects a data object is a data

00:40.780 --> 00:41.330
frame object.

00:42.400 --> 00:47.530
So now you can see the other individual countries of information available to us.

00:47.770 --> 00:53.810
So each country as its me is serving in a I'll call organisms and mine serving spirit serving these

00:53.840 --> 00:55.620
days really will be test.

00:55.670 --> 01:03.120
Now let's say you want to grab the third countries information so you can use this not a lot matter

01:03.520 --> 01:10.000
and you can use the positional BS argument instead of that you can use this lot smarter and use this

01:10.000 --> 01:16.630
position and these arguments of let's say tournaments index number will be pointing to two is pointing

01:16.630 --> 01:17.970
to Nigeria.

01:18.010 --> 01:19.990
Let me just executed.

01:19.990 --> 01:26.250
Now you can see it has given us one deprecation warning in effect from the future war zone.

01:26.260 --> 01:28.250
It is going to become a deprecated.

01:28.450 --> 01:34.470
So they are suggesting that this dark matter is anyhow going to become deprecated.

01:34.480 --> 01:41.290
So please use this dot lock and dialogue so not lobbies for a label with indexing and not look for the

01:41.290 --> 01:44.760
position that is indexing as we already seen in the last years.

01:45.130 --> 01:52.240
So any or this property of this data frame object like Anata yes is going to become a duplicate but

01:52.330 --> 01:58.230
I just want to show you that most of the kind of indexing you can possibly do it.

01:58.270 --> 02:04.410
So now let's say you want to really great in this area.

02:04.420 --> 02:10.620
So instead of passing let's it do you can even pass the Atlanta area.

02:10.750 --> 02:17.500
Now you can imagine that most of the time so indexing mechanism will work to drive the data in case

02:17.500 --> 02:19.660
of this property.

02:19.780 --> 02:24.880
Now you can see exactly the same data you retrieve as we all retired earlier.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.770
You can even use this range of values.

02:27.910 --> 02:34.810
So let's say we can use no x so let's say from 3 to 7 currently we want to reclaim.

02:36.400 --> 02:44.010
So we have countries like between 3 to 7 like Angola Angola Antigua and Barbuda and Argentina.

02:44.020 --> 02:52.110
Let's use the same lottery x property with the help of this rather than positional based argument will

02:52.120 --> 02:53.670
pass the legal base argument.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.850
So let's see the first argument we posit like Andorra.

02:58.510 --> 03:01.420
So I'm just going to select 10 pasted here.

03:02.100 --> 03:06.730
And after cologne we are going to pass another Laker Argentina.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.530
OK let me just execute.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.910
So now you can see the same set of information.

03:12.910 --> 03:14.280
It has very.

03:14.470 --> 03:21.900
So it is not a property you can use both of this indexing label means indexing or a positional base

03:21.910 --> 03:27.470
indexing in one same property rather than using this dot block and not a lock matter.

03:27.700 --> 03:32.770
But as this finalizes giving warning that it's a deprecation mining it anyhow it is going to become

03:32.770 --> 03:33.330
deprecated.

03:33.340 --> 03:39.530
So if you upgrade your library find us in a future you may not find this not its proper.

03:39.960 --> 03:40.290
OK.

03:40.390 --> 03:42.860
So I just want to introduce you.

03:42.880 --> 03:49.330
That is not I property properties a replacement of kind of most of this property like a dot lock and

03:49.330 --> 03:50.640
a dot I lock.

03:50.740 --> 03:57.760
But I would highly suggest to you that as finders community is suggesting to use this lock method and

03:57.760 --> 04:01.540
not I lock meter for it trial the individual flows of information.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.880
OK so that's all about this video.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.480
See you in the next video.
